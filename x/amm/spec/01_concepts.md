# Concepts

## AMM

Decentralized exchanges have become a cornerstone of the cryptocurrency
ecosystem, offering a revolutionary alternative to traditional, centralized
trading platforms.
The debate over the ideal exchange model has been a long-running topic of
discussion, with the Automated Market Maker (AMM) DEXs providing traders with
simple and low-friction trading experience, but being relatively limited in
handling large volumes and suffering from capital inefficiency, while
orderbook-based DEXs offer complex order types and precise price discovery,
but require a third-party market maker for liquidity management and can be
complex and intimidating for less experienced traders.
In response to these limitations, a new solution has emerged - the hybrid DEX.
This approach combines the advantages of both AMM and order book DEXs,
offering a greater degree of flexibility, scalability, and liquidity management,
while minimizing the drawbacks of both.

The hybrid DEX offers traders an optimal trading experience, providing the
best of both worlds, with a more efficient, transparent, and decentralized
platform that reflects the underlying ethos of the cryptocurrency movement.
By utilizing the unique features of both AMM and orderbook-based DEXs,
the hybrid DEX not only provides a new standard in decentralized trading,
but also serves as a powerful symbol of the transformative power of blockchain
technology and the ideals it stands for. Furthermore, this hybrid model enhances
the user experience by allowing traders to take full advantage of both DEX
models, providing them with greater control and confidence in their trading
activities.
Ultimately, the hybrid DEX represents a significant step forward in the
evolution of decentralized exchanges, allowing traders to benefit from a more
secure, efficient, and seamless experience.

## Pool

The pool is a fundamental component of the AMM DEX ecosystem, as it provides the
liquidity necessary for traders to be able to easily swap tokens without relying
on order matching.
Pool investors play a critical role in providing this liquidity, and they are
compensated for their efforts through a proportional share of the trading fees
earned by the exchange.
Without pool investors, exchanges may suffer from low liquidity, resulting in
lower trading volumes and high price slippage which can be unattractive to
traders.

Even in hybrid DEX, pool investors are still important for some reasons.
In a traditional orderbook-based exchange, the quality of the exchange can be
degraded unless there are active market makers.
Without market makers, the order book can be very thin, which can make it
difficult for traders to find counterparties for their trades.
This can lead to higher spreads, longer wait times for trades to be executed.
In contrast, liquidity provided by pool investors tends to be more passive and
not reliant on human market makers.
This means that the exchange can provide stable liquidity for trading pairs even
when market makers are not active or for tokens that may not be profitable
enough for market makers to enter.
This can improve the overall trading experience for users and help to ensure
that there is stable liquidity to support trading activity on the exchange.

It is worth noting that pool investing has become a novel approach to investing.
In traditional financial markets, market-making is largely monopolized by
licensed professional or institutional investors who use their own capital to
provide liquidity and capture profits.
However, AMM DEXs have disrupted this monopoly structure by allowing individual
users to participate in market-making and earn rewards regardless of the amount
of capital they have.
While pool investing provides users with the opportunity to earn passive income
and additional rewards, it is not without risks.
Investing in a pool exposes users to the possibility of divergence losses, also
known as impermanent losses.
This is akin to a gamma short strategy and requires users to carefully weigh the
potential profits and losses before making a decision.
In this sense, pool investing represents a new approach to investing, one that
requires users to navigate unique risks and opportunities.
While it may not be entirely new, the way that pool investing is implemented in
AMM DEXs and decentralized finance is innovative and represents a promising new
area of investment for those who are willing to understand and manage the risks
involved.

### Constant Product Model (CPM)

The unique feature of the AMM used in Uniswap and other similar decentralized
exchanges is that it can provide liquidity for any size of order, regardless of
the size of the liquidity pool.
This is accomplished by using a mathematical formula known as the constant
product model(CPM), which ensures that the product of the two tokens in a
liquidity pool remains constant.

The constant product model is designed to adjust the price of the tokens in the
liquidity pool in response to changes in demand.
As the demand for a token increases, the price of that token will increase,
encouraging liquidity providers to add more of that token to the pool.
Conversely, as the demand for a token decreases, the price of that token will
decrease, encouraging traders to sell that token and reducing the amount of that
token in the pool.

The term "constant" in the constant product model refers to the fact that any
trade on the exchange must change the reserves in such a way that the product of
those reserves remains unchanged.
This ensures that the price of the tokens in the pool remains in proportion to
the amount of each token in the pool.

Concentrated liquidity(Ranged Liquidity) is a special form of the CPM.
This feature allows liquidity providers to choose a specific price range to
provide liquidity for, enabling them to concentrate their capital in a narrower
range.
Liquidity providers can determine the price range they want to support by
adjusting the weights of the tokens in the liquidity pool.
This allows for more efficient use of capital since providers can allocate their
funds in a more targeted way, improving the overall liquidity of the exchange.
This feature is particularly useful for less-liquid markets, where liquidity is
not enough to cover full price range.
In addition, for pairs where the relative price between two tokens remains
roughly the same or changes slowly, concentrating liquidity in a narrow range
can generate large utility with little capital.

## Farming

In the context of AMM DEX, farming refers to a process where users provide
liquidity to a pool and, in return, receive rewards usually in the form of
governance token of the DEX.
Although it is the same as swap fee (trading fee) in that it is the profit of
the pool investors, farming reward is a basic reward provided by the DEX to
attract pool investors, so it is given to users regardless of the actual swap
frequency.
The amount of rewards that users can earn depends on several factors, including
the farming plan of the DEX, the size of the liquidity pool, the duration of the
farming period.
As previously mentioned, farming rewards in AMM DEXs are typically the
governance token of the DEX.
However, there are instances where other tokens are added to create synergies
with external protocols.
In these cases, the external protocol may specify their preferred trading token
pairs, liquidity providing range, and type of reward token they wish to offer in
order to ensure the best possible outcome.
In this way, users can benefit from both the farming rewards and the external
tokens, making it a worthwhile endeavor for those interested in participating in
the AMM DEXs.
